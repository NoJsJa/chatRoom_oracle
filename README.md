# chatRoom_oracle
The project is the same as the chatRoom project in my Repositories, but I use oracle db this time to replace mysql, also including some bugs fix and page-layout changing. More better!
When clone this project to local. you need to change it's name to "chatRoom" which now is "chatRoom_oracle", or you will encounter some errors.
